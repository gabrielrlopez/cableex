        Welcome to CableEx (the "Site").
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site,
        especially when conducting business.
        <br></br>
        This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users
        of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without
        <br></br>
        transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on
        the Site and make use of the various services offered by CableEx
        <br></br>
        (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").

        <b>"Personally Identifiable Information"</b>
        <br></br>
        refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify,
        contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains,
        including, but
        <br></br>
        not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address,
        financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information.
        <br></br>
        Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is
        collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual
        user)
        <br></br>
        or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b>
        <br></br>
        We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.
        We collect the following additional information from our Authorized
        <br></br>
        Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of
        Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the
        <br></br> nature and size of the advertising inventory that the
        Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>What organizations are collecting the information? </b>
        <br></br>
        In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party
        service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and
        banks) who
        <br></br>
        may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may
        collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We
        <br></br> do not control how these third parties use such information,
        but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information
        provided to them
        <br></br>
        from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may
        be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain,
        and do
        <br></br>
        not store, retain, or use the information given to them.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b>
        <br></br>
        We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to
        make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling
        requests on
        <br></br>
        the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research
        or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related
        <br></br>
        to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally
        Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in

        <br></br>
        specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.

        <br></br>
        <b>With whom may the information may be shared?</b>
        <br></br>
        Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be
        shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential
        <br></br>
        transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated
        information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our
        Visitors
        <br></br>
        and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party
        vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving
        information
        <br></br> or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our
        behalf.
        <br></br>

        Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain
        information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they
        select.
        <br></br> We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our
        Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged
        on and the site
        <br></br> is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log
        the Authorized Customer off.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        </b>
        <br></br>
        CableEx has entered into and will continue to enter into partnerships
        and other affiliations with a number of vendors. Such vendors
        <br></br> may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information
        on a need to know basis for
        <br></br>
        evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility.

        Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. We
        will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply
        with a<br></br> court order or subpoena or a request from a law
        enforcement agency to release information. We will also disclose

        <b>
          How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?
        </b>
        <br></br>
        All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and
        practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and
        Authorized
        <br></br>
        Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees
        who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. We
        <br></br>
        audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive
        information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is
        <br></br>
        protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent
        over the Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to
        <br></br>
        maintain a secure site, electronic communications and databases are
        subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or
        <br></br>
        warrant that such events will not take place and we will not be liable
        to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.<br></br>

        <b>
          How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable
          Information?
        </b>
        <br></br>
        Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally
        Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by
        <br></br>
        emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@CableEx.biz">info@CableEx.biz</a>

        <b>
          Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information
          collected by the Site?
        </b>
        <br></br>
        We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to
        delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's
        database<br></br> by contacting{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@CableEx.biz">info@CableEx.biz</a>. However, because
        of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a
        Visitor's entry without<br></br> retaining some residual information. An
        individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information
        deactivated will have this<br></br> information functionally deleted,
        and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable
        Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
        <br></br>

        <b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b>
        <br></br>
        We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to
        our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we
        <br></br> are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause
        disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or
        Authorized Customer<br></br>
        has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor
        or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to
